# Splicing-Master
#Image splicing
is a prominent method of digital image 
manipulation. The term "image splicing" refers to the 
cutting and pasting of a specific region of a donor image 
into the host image. Spliced region identification has a long 
history in digital picture forensics.

#video Splicing
The volume of image data generated in the last decade has 
exploded thanks to the emergence of social networking 
platforms like Facebook, Telegram, and Instagram. For
internet companies like Facebook, the use of image (and 
video) editing software like Adobe Photoshop to make 
doctored photographs and films is a major worry. These 
photos are common sources of fake news and are frequently 
utilized in unethical ways, such as encouraging mobs. We 
must establish the authenticity of a problematic photograph 
before taking action based on it. Image forgery can be 
problematic in a variety of situations.

# Dataset used:
We are using Columbia[1] dataset. In this dataset, there 
are two folder, first folder(4cam_auth) contains authentic 
images, and second folder(4cam_splc) contains spliced 
images. By the term 'authentic', we mean an image that is 
taken using single camera. The 4cam_auth folder contains 
183 images and in 4cam_splc, there are 180.
# For Video Splicing 
We are using a mixed dataset which consists of equal 
amount of videos from different dataset sources like 
YouTube, FaceForensics++[26], Video Splicing detection 
challenge dataset[25](see Figure ). Our newly prepared 
dataset contains 50% of the original video and 50% of the 
manipulated Video Splicing videos. The dataset is split
into 70% train and 30% test.
